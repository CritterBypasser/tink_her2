Project Description
Our project is an innovative solution for those who are unable to use a shopping trolley.  Once the RFID has been activated by the customer card, the trolley follows the RFID tag till the shopping is over. Afterwards, if the trolley has been abandoned at the sidelines of the parking lot, a master card can be used to return all of them to the initial charging point.

The Problem statement
Device a solution to help people, disabled or just unable to use a shopping cart, easily maneuver large amounts of groceries.

The Solution
We try to achieve the solution by automating the process of pulling the cart along, which is the task requiring most physical exertion.

Technical Details
Technologies/Components Used
For Software: Arduino IDE, HTML, CSS and JavaScript
For Hardware: IR sensor, RFID card and reader, ultrasonic sensor, Arduino driver shield (L298) , servo motor (micro) , gear motor, ESP 32 microcontroller and Arduino UNO microcontroller
